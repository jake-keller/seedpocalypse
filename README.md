# seedpocalypse

The Scene: The world has experienced cataclysmic natural disasters, causing crops across the world to be ruined and the future of humanity's food stores to be put into question. Luckily, Svalbard Seed Vault in Norway has been collecting and storing seed samples of over a million unique plants across the globe to protect plant species from going extinct.

The Mission: We're saving the world!! Let's use data to rebuild the world's food supply by helping match seeds in the vault with farms where these crops can viably be grown. By using data from the Svebald Seed Vault, cross referenced with data from plant information databases from sources like the USDA, WorldFlora and European Food Information Resource, we will help match interested growers with the crops that can be regrown in their area.

The Catch: Historical data will only take us so far as global weather patterns have been altered. We will also employ the help of RSS Feeds, Sensor data and weather API's to help give our crops the best chance possible to survive
